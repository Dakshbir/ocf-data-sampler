## **1. Introduction and Project Goals**  
Open Climate Fix (OCF) uses massive amounts of satellite and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data in Zarr format for training ML models like PVNet. Traditionally, OCF relies on local data copies rather than leveraging cloud storage directly, creating significant operational overhead and storage costs.

This project explores **Ice Chunk** as a cloud-native solution for direct cloud data access, addressing the fundamental bottleneck of downloading large Zarr datasets. The primary goals were to:

- **Enable Cloud-Native Data Streaming**: Implement high-performance satellite data loading directly from cloud storage using the Ice Chunk library
- **Benchmark Performance**: Compare Ice Chunk streaming performance against traditional plain Zarr approaches  
- **Provide Production-Ready Tools**: Create conversion pipelines, benchmarking utilities, and integration infrastructure
- **Validate Feasibility**: Demonstrate that cloud-native access can match or exceed local disk performance for future PVNet training workflows

## **2. Related Work / Literature**

### **Ice Chunk**  
Ice Chunk is a Python library providing a transactional, cloud-optimized storage layer for Zarr data. It offers:
- **Version Control**: Git-like semantics for data repositories with commits and branches
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Optimized for object storage (GCS, S3) with efficient streaming
- **Zarr Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Zarr-based workflows
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent caching and parallel I/O for high-throughput access

Key benefits for OCF's use case:
- Eliminates need for local data copies through direct cloud streaming
- Provides data versioning and reproducibility for ML experiments
- Offers superior performance through optimized cloud storage patterns

### **OCF's Current Data Architecture**  
- **Data Sources**: Multi-modal satellite imagery (MSG SEVIRI) and NWP forecasts  
- **Current Workflow**: Download → Local Storage → ML Training
- **Challenge**: Growing dataset sizes make local storage increasingly impractical
- **Vision**: Direct cloud streaming for scalable, cost-effective ML training

## **3. Technical Implementation / My Contribution**

### **Cloud-Native Data Streaming Architecture**

The architecture above illustrates OCF's transformation from traditional download-first workflows to direct cloud streaming using Ice Chunk's transactional storage layer.

### **Unified Architecture Design**
Implemented a clean, unified approach using a single `zarr_path` field with **suffix-based dispatching**:

```python
# Ice Chunk repositories
zarr_path: "gs://bucket/dataset.icechunk@commit_id"

# Standard Zarr datasets  
zarr_path: "gs://bucket/dataset.zarr"
```

The system automatically detects data format and routes to the appropriate optimized loader without requiring separate configuration fields.

### **Core Technical Components**

| Component | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Unified Satellite Loader** | Format-aware data loading | Suffix-based dispatching, regex path parsing, robust error handling |
| **Ice Chunk Integration** | Cloud repository access | GCS optimization, commit/branch support, fallback mechanisms |
| **Conversion Pipeline** | Dataset migration tool | OCF-Blosc2 codec cleanup, optimal data restructuring, batch processing |
| **Benchmarking Suite** | Performance validation | Statistical analysis, throughput measurement, comparison utilities |

The conversion process transforms existing OCF Zarr datasets into high-performance Ice Chunk format:

1. **Codec Compatibility**: Removes OCF-Blosc2 compression dependencies
2. **Data Restructuring**: Converts from unified data variable to separate channel variables (IR_016, VIS006, etc.)
3. **Batch Processing**: Handles large datasets through memory-efficient streaming
4. **Version Control**: Creates Git-like commits for reproducible data snapshots

### **Performance Optimizations**
Applied cloud-native optimizations for maximum throughput:

```python
# GCS Streaming Configuration
os.environ["GCSFS_CACHE_TIMEOUT"] = "3600"
os.environ["GCSFS_BLOCK_SIZE"] = str(64 * 1024 * 1024)  # 64MB blocks
os.environ["GCSFS_DEFAULT_CACHE_TYPE"] = "readahead"
os.environ["GOOGLE_CLOUD_DISABLE_GRPC"] = "true"

# Dask Optimization  
dask.config.set({
    "distributed.worker.memory.target": 0.7,
    "array.chunk-size": "512MB", 
    "distributed.worker.threads": 2,
})
```
